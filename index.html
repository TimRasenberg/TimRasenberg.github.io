        <h2> My choice </h2>
        <p> Choosing what study I was going to do was actually a pretty difficult decision, I have quite a lot of interests.</p>
        <p> I was choosing between 3 main options:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Game development in Breda</li>
            <li>Film school </li>
            <li>HBO ICT </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I chose for the third option because I think the study really fits me as a person. </p>
        <p>I don't like studying day in and day out, I like to get something done. And in this case that would be in the form of projects. </p>
        <p>I went for an HBO level study because I feel like that fits my capabilities best. It pushes me just enough to where I can learn new things</p>
        <p>while not overwhelming me. </p>
