        <h2>My Personal Motivation</h2>
        <p>I've always been interested in computers, mostly because I've been playing video games all my life. </p>
        <p>That's why my personal motivation to do this study is to get familiar with software development, and maybe later go into game development.</p>
        <p>Game design and storytelling are one of my interests, I want to be able to craft a game that really means something. I want it to say something.</p>

        <h2>Theory, What is motivation?</h2>
        <p>According to Beata Souders, a researcher with a PHD in psychology. Motivation in its simpelest form is a sense of wanting</p>
        <p>We want a change in circumstance, emotion etc. And our behaviour and actions change to accomplish that change</p>
        <p>There are multiple forms of motivation, but the 2 most important are Extrinsic and Intrinsic</p>
        <p>Extrinsic motivation is a form of motivation that doesn't come from ourselves, it usually comes from people with power over you</p>
        <p>This can be a teacher, a boss at your job or a police officer for example. They kind of give orders that give you motivation since they hold power over you</p>
        <p>Intrinsic motivation comes from you yourself. This can come from various sources, for example if what you're motivated to do aligns with your moral values</p>
        <p>Or if you really want to do something because you just enjoy the activity, for example watching a movie or playing a game.</p>

        <h2>Dan Pink's View on motivation</h2>
        <p>According to Dan Pink motivation isn't merely driven by financial sources, hence why people choose jobs they like typically obviously.</p>
        <p>And while money CAN be a motivator to do work, it doesn't leave the person with that much satisfaction. It's more of a carrot on a stick approach.</p>
        <p>He states that when people notice that they are being paid fairly for their work, they will begin to work for intrinsic motivators like the one's discussed before.</p>
        <p>But Pink specifies 3  motivator</p>     
        <ol>
            <li>Autonomy, a sense of self control that people like to experience.</li>
            <li>Mastery, pink argues that getting better at a certain skill set can be extremely satisfying </li>
            <li>Purpose, working (especially on things you're interested in) can give the person a great sense of purpose </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Performance Motivation</h2>
        <p>According to the test I'm either Intrinsically motivated or a liar </p>
        <p>And I agree (With the first part at least). I do what I do because I have a personal goal of working in the videogame industry, not for the money but for the creative outlet.</p>
        <h2>Career Anchor</h2>
        <p>Creativity and Work Relationships are the most important to me, as an aspiring game developer/designer I think creativity isa fundemental part of that process</p>
        <p>I've also worked in enviroments with toxic colleagues so I know the value of colleagues</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I already kind of knew what motivated me to do this. I have an interest in game development. Not in the pac-man way where you make a little fun something</p>
        <p>But more in the way that I want to tell a story, make a game that has meaning to people and can make people think. That's my motivation to do this study and that's kind of what the tests showed me too.</p>
